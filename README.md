# Apps:

This is a repository with three apps:

1. # Palindrome

A palindrome is a word, number, phrase that reads the same backwards and forwards e.g. madam, racecar. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome

Specs/Requirements:

- Use ReactJS to create your app
- Keep it short and simple, e.g. a textbox where user inputs word, number or phrase and a label field which shows weather given word, number or phrase is palindrome or not
- Feel free to use any react component library or hooks e.g. useState, useMemo
- Use whatever css, styling you learned in other courses
- You may use CSS framework if needed e.g. React Bootstrap / Material UI or whatever for styling GUI

2. # Bubble sort / Selection sort

Bubble sort and Selection sort are simplest sorting algorithms.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort

Specs/Requirements:

- Use ReactJS to create your app
- Keep it short and simple, e.g. a textbox where user inputs array and sorting is done according to these items or you can also manually insert array values inside code
- Feel free to use any react component library or hooks e.g. useState, useMemo
- Use whatever css, styling you learned in other courses
- You may use CSS framework if needed e.g. React Bootstrap / Material UI or whatever for styling GUI
- Use any of the sorting algorithms alternative to bubble sort or selection sort (i.e. mergesort, quick sort and radix sort)
- Optional: use both or more than one sorting algorithms (e.g. bubble and selection sort)

3. # Stack Data Structure app: LIFO and FIFO

I have created a STACK DATA STRUCTURE APP which follows a certain order of operations - LIFO (Last In First Out) (if I use the pop method) and FIFO (First In First Out) (if I use the shift method): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)

Specs/Requirements:

- Use ReactJS to create your app
- Keep it short and simple, e.g. one button that shows pushing items to stack and another button that shows poping items out of stack
- Feel free to use any react component library or hooks e.g. useState, useMemo
- Use whatever css, styling you learned in other courses
- You may use CSS framework if needed e.g. React Bootstrap / Material UI or whatever for styling GUI
